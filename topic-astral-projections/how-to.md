# How to Astral Project

1. Relax, both physically and mentally.
2. Enter a hypnagogic state, or half-sleep.
3. Deepen the state by prioritizing mental sensation over physical sensation.
4. Pay attention to the presence of vibration in your environment, which becomes 
  apparent in a state of deep attention.
5. Incur the vibration in your physical body, and relax into its presence. The 
  purpose of this is to gently jiggle the subtle body out of the physical body.
6. Focus your thoughts on leaving the limbs and the torso, and try to do so one 
  at a time.
7. Known as “lifting out,” focus on effortlessly drifting out of your physical body.
